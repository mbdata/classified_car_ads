# Classified Car Ads Dataset - Hadoop, Hive, and R

## Introduction
For this project, I am going to be using the classified car ads dataset from the popular machine learning website, Kaggle. Here is the link to get the data: https://www.kaggle.com/mirosval/personal-cars-classifieds

The purpose of this project is to show others how to use Hadoop to load data, query and table this data using Hive, and finally, to get the data onto your local computer for analysis. I will be using the statistical software R to explore the data.

## What is Required?
I am using Git Bash for Windows on my local server, so all of my terminal commands will be those found on Linux. You will be required to have access to Hadoop; I am using a commercial distribution provided by Hortonworks, called Hortonworks Hadoop Sandbox, which allows me access to Hadoop through a virtual machine. Here is a link to get Hortonworks Sandbox (it's free): https://hortonworks.com/products/sandbox/. You also need to have R installed on your computer so that you can follow along with the data analysis section of this project.
