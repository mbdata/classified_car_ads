# Classified Car Ads Dataset - Hadoop, Hive, and R

## Introduction
For this project, we are going to be using the classified car ads dataset from the popular machine learning website, Kaggle. Here is the link to get the data: https://www.kaggle.com/mirosval/personal-cars-classifieds

The purpose of this project is to show you how to use Hadoop to load data, query and table this data using Hive, and finally, to get the data onto your local computer for analysis. I will be using the statistical software R to analyze the data.

## What is Required?
We are using Git Bash for Windows on our local server, so all of the terminal commands will be those found on Linux. You will be required to have access to Hadoop -- we are using a commercial distribution provided by Hortonworks, called Hortonworks Hadoop Sandbox, which allows us to access Hadoop through a virtual machine. Here is a link to get Hortonworks Sandbox (it's free): https://hortonworks.com/products/sandbox/. You also need to have R installed on your computer so that you can follow along with the analysis of the data.
